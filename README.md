The figurative scenario is a variant of the famous Romeo and Juliet playby William Shakespeare. In the original tragedy, the two lovers face an impossible relation because of the ongoing rivalry between their families. Here, our scenario is just slightly different; whereby the playwriter, William Shakespeare, gets acquaintance with the two lovers and an exchange of love letters commence with the playwriter playing a kind of matchmaker between the two while writing the play about the love story. In this figurative scenario, the verses of the play correspond to the different values of the ODE over time.
